# ASCII-Art-Generator
#### Description
A simple application that allows the user to convert image files into an ASCII text representation. For each pixel (or group of pixels) in the image, a brightness value is determined and the appropriate ASCII character is mapped to that location. The user is able to adjust the size of the ASCII output as well as save the output to a text file.

#### Usage
Simply build the source files and run the application.
